The Nubis project had a requirement for a highly available network address transation
(HA NAT) instance.  There are a number of ways to solve this problem, but the solution
found here:  http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/making-aws-nat-instances-highly-available-without-the-compromises
looked pretty good.

This repository is code based on the above solution, with a few tweaks.
